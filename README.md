# Primitive-Soccer-Analysis
This is my first attempt at building a machine learning project by myself. I decided that I wanted to use a Random Forest Regressor.
What I did was a very primitive apprach and there are many things that I will fix in my code (by making it cleaner, simpler, and more efficient).
With that said I am really excited with the progress (although minimal) that I have made!
